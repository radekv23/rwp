# Real-world phenomenon project for Programming for Data Analysis at GMIT.
by G00352936

### Problem statement

>For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of
your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is
of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data
related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.
We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.

>Specifically, in this project you should:
>- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
>- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.
>- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
>- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

>Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some
students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to
base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),
but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set.
